# Starting Point Project for YouTube Videos

This repository serves as the starting point for many of my YouTube videos. In each video, I begin with the code provided here and build upon it to
demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques.

## Project Overview

This project is a basic setup for an API server using Node.js and Express. The server is configured with essential middleware for logging, CORS,
routing, and error handling. It's designed to be a flexible foundation that you can easily extend and customize.

### Key Features

-   **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js.
-   **CORS**: Configured to allow requests from any origin with various HTTP methods.
-   **Logging**: Middleware integrated for logging HTTP requests and other important events.
-   **Routing**: Dynamic route definition with controller-based architecture.
-   **Error Handling**: Custom middleware to handle undefined routes and return appropriate responses.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure the environment**:

    - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
    - Update the environment variables as needed.

4. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will start running at the configured hostname and port, and you'll see log messages in the console confirming the server's activity.
